' Implementation examples
note right of ReactMemo
  React.memo Example:
  const UserRow = React.memo(({ user, onSelect }) => {
    return <div onClick={() => onSelect(user)}>{user.name}</div>;
  });
end note

note right of TanStackQuery
  TanStack Query Example:
  const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['users', filters],
    queryFn: () => fetchUsers(filters),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
    cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000,
  });
end note

note right of CodeSplitting
  Code Splitting Example:
  const UserManagementPage = lazy(() => 
    import('./UserManagementPage')
  );
end note

note right of UseCaseExecutor
  Performance Monitoring:
  const executor = UseCaseExecutorFactory.createWithMiddlewares([
    new PerformanceMiddleware(),
    new LoggingMiddleware(console.log),
  ]);
end note
